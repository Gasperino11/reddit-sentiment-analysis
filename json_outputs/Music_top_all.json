We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.  WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.  WHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.  WHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.  WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist.  HOW CAN I JOIN?  Click here and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one , and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.  /u/JPTIII [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "Music", "title": "The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving.

Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services or watch music videos -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels, stifling independent voices  But there\u2019s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.  We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.  Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.  To reach the call in line directly by phone, call 202-930-8550 .  When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:   I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

I know this topic has been done by many, including Gus Johnson, but it's now Serial Abuser Chris Brown's birthday and his fans are in full swing.  Here's just a short list of everything publicly he's done wrong:    He beat Rihanna nearly to death [2009]  He stormed off set and broke something when asked about that assault [2011]  Stole someone's phone just for taking pictures of him [2012]  Shoved someone in a club so hard she needed surgery [2013]  Picked a fight with Frank Ocean over a parking space and threatened to kill him  Arrested for Assualt after a fight infront of a DC hotel [2013]  Violated the rehab program's rules [2014]  Named in a battery case, only dropped because victim declined to press charges [2015]  Serial Abuser Chris broke a woman's phone after she refused to leave his bus as well as throwing her out [2015]  Accused of punching a woman in the face and taking her phone during a private party [2016]  Manager accused him of attacking her [2016]  Threatened a woman with a gun and arrested after hours long police standoff [2016]  Sucker punched a photographer [2017]  Sent threatening text messages to an ex-girlfriend [2017]  Detained in Paris after woman says he raped her [2019]*  Paris Rape accuser says he forced her to take cocaine and raped her multiple times [2019]*   *This is still an open case. Not much is known except French (like American) police must release someone if there is no evidence in a certain time period. That time period is 24 hours unless proper cause is determined to extend to 48 total hours. This is why Brown was able to leave the country after a few days.   I'm just gonna say, how is this guy still popular? He's been to jail for assault more times than I've gotten an A on an exam. And this is just what we know about. What else is there that isn't public?  Edit: Sort by controversial if you want to see some stupidity.  Edit 2: Since apparently people are questioning the motive:  I didn't plan this for days or anything. I literally saw his name trending on Twitter at ~3pm today and said \"Hey, isn't this guy a major duche canoe? Let's remind the world of him shall we?\" A quick google search later, I found 3 articles that were compiled lists of things he's directly done wrong. For years that were missing from the lists, I did a different search specifically for that year. I checked every post on this list. They all happened. At this point, it doesn't matter why they happened because I'm pretty sure there's 0 excuse for a police standoff outside your own home right? Or am I just crazy?  IDK. I don't have a motive in this other than to remind the world that this guy exists. If people in other industries can be torn down by ONE accusation (see Toby from Tobuscus) then why is Brown still thriving when he's got over a dozen under his belt? And to make it even worse, most of them he's been officially convicted of. Like, spent time in jail, convicted.  I seem to have made my point. Anything that's not ^ was purely coincidental or made up by you. It was not my intention and likely never will be. I've read every top level comment that's been responded here. All 1.5k of you or something.  I know we can \"separate the art from the artist\" but that doesn't make much sense does it? In other industries, people accused of harassment lose their jobs and have their careers stripped without being proven guilty. Meanwhile, Serial Abuser Chris Brown here (and others in the music industry) are perfectly fine with beating and raping people and still being praised as a \"king/queen\" or \"hero.\" It's disgusting. We need a Weinstein era purge of the music industry. Get rid of these garbage humans. Most of the time, they're only useful for their voice and lots of people have those.  You know what, screw it. I'm going to start addressing him a \"Serial Abuser Chris Brown\" now. Not just \"(Serial Abuser) Chris Brown.\"  Edit 3: And.... locked. Racists and others of the like are out in full swing on this post. Just a couple reminders.  Most of this ^ isn't \"Alleged\", especially the Rihanna incident. He was found guilty so he is guilty.  Secondly, this is a list of things that factually happened. There's no \"Allegedly\" to having a police standoff. That for a fact happened.  /u/Sprinkley_Binkley [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "Music", "title": "Trey Parker - America, Fuck Yeah!

My point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have LPs, CDs, or even MP3s lying around. I have never used or wanted band merch, and I simply don't get a chance to see bands I really like that often. So my point, once again, was to have a feature to DONATE to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that I listen to music on, which I realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well.  Also to clarify, I understand that a lot of work goes into writing/recording/putting out a record; in a perfect world, this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their label/legal/creative team however they saw fit.  EDIT: Wow! I don't really understand how gold/upvotes work... I made this post a few days ago and didn't even realize that ANYONE had commented on it. Psyched to read all your thoughts!
