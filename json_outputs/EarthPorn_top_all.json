This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. This fight isn\u2019t over though, there is still a clear path to victory.  The organizations behind Battle For The Net are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via Congressional Review Act (CRA).  The CRA let\u2019s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it\u2019s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC\u2019s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. But it won\u2019t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.  We can\u2019t stop now. Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act  You\u2019ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:   I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a \u201cresolution of disapproval\u201d reversing the FCC\u2019s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.\u201d   You can also text BATTLE to Text \"BATTLE\" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers  We can still win this. Even if you\u2019ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck.
