After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.  \"Pope Francis,\" his boss replies.  \"Sure!\" says Dave. \"I've known the Pope for years.\" So off they fly to Rome.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.  Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.  And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...  And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.  And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.  Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.  The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.  The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.  The old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"   EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.

What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?\"  \"HE'S ON TO US\" mathematician #1 screeches  Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.  The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. \"FOOLS\" it booms in unison, \"I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA\"  The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. \"But wait\" he inturrupts, thinking fast, \"if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!\"  The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. \"My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!\" and with that, they vanish.
