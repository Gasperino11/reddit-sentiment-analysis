It\u2019s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.  Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. It\u2019s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.

I figured I\u2019d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn\u2019t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it\u2026.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that\u2019s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:  1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot, as they\u2019ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.  So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there\u2019s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it\u2019s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they\u2019re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn\u2019t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!  Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven\u2019t passed, then it\u2019s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign. Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.   Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what\u2019s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don\u2019t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You\u2019ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it\u2019s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.   For reference, here\u2019s what a normal cranking sound should be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0  Here\u2019s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It\u2019s at about :55 secs : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng  If you listen closely, you\u2019ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.  If the car you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don\u2019t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you\u2019re looking at with something like \u201cYYYY Make Model clear flood\u201d or \u201cYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump\u201d and see if there\u2019s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.  Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.   Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don\u2019t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you\u2019re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it\u2019s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it\u2019s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford\u2019s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That\u2019s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven\u2019t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That\u2019s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that\u2019s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That\u2019s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don\u2019t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you\u2019re SOL there.  Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it\u2019s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.  Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they\u2019ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It\u2019s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that\u2019s better. Indy\u2019s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that\u2019s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that\u2019s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don\u2019t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn\u2019t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.  Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?  Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can\u2019t see?  How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.  Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they\u2019re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.  Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn\u2019t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They\u2019ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They\u2019ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you\u2019re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.  Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you\u2019re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it\u2019s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you\u2019re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it\u2019s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.  This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It\u2019s also pretty important. You\u2019ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it\u2019s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that\u2019s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it\u2019s adding, but sometimes it\u2019s subtracting). I don\u2019t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.   So what you\u2019re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it\u2019s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You\u2019re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find \u201cshort term fuel trim\u201d and \u201clong term fuel trim\u201d. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.  Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%  Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%  Let\u2019s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You\u2019re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the \u201cbank\u201d or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one \u201cside\u201d so you\u2019ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you\u2019ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you\u2019re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn\u2019t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.  When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you\u2019ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let\u2019s take a look at some examples on a V8:  STFT1 : 3 ... STFT2 : 6  LTFT1 : 2 ... LTFT2 : 1  So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That\u2019s pretty good.  STFT1 : -5 ... STFT2 : 3  LTFT1 : 3 ... LTFT2 : 1  Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that\u2019s good.  STFT1 : 6 ... STFT2 : 7  LTFT1 : 10 ... LTFT2 :15  Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That\u2019s not good. Walk away from this one.  Here's one more that's a littlte different:  STFT1 : -20 ... STFT2 : -20  LTFT1 : 22 ... LTFT2 : 20  Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.  Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.  Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.   Last and not least, don\u2019t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don\u2019t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you\u2019re worried about is no big deal, it\u2019s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it\u2019s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn\u2019t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don\u2019t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.   I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents\u2019 cars, friends\u2019 cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you\u2019re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won\u2019t forget anything.  \u200b  EDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post here talking about it, and a few other good things as well.  \u200b  EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.  \u200b  EDIT2 - Fixed some formatting  \u200b  EDIT3 - Thanks for all the replies and awards. I'm glad people found this useful. But seriously, no more awards. Save your money for gas to return all those Christmas presents you don't want.  \u200b  EDIT4 - There are lots of comments and questions. I'll try to answer what I can but there are so many. I'll get back to most of you eventually. Gotta get some work done....working on a Saturday (sucks)  \u200b  EDIT5 - I'm back from the dead!  \u200b  EDIT6 - added some good info brought up in comments, expanded on a few things, laymanized it a little more, explained some technical stuff. Still can't get the STFT and LTFT examples to format the way I wanted. Best I can do  \u200b  EDIT 8 - Good night everyone. Thanks for all the awards and comments and conversations. I replied to all the PMs and chats. Tried to reply to as many comments as I could, but holy cow there were just too many.

Instead of \"hey, thanks for helping out\" the end. I got \"what's wrong with you? Did you bump your head or something\" and I remember one time I was washing up, my mum called for \"everyone come quick\" because I was doing the washing up and it'll never happen again so take a look whilst you can.  Even now, as an adult, if she's over and I get the hoover out she'll say \"are you feeling alright\" and my sister now says it too.  It makes me so uncomfortable that I have to clean in private, when my partner is out. I feel like I'm being ridiculed or judged if there is anyone in the house. Then once I've got it perfect if my mum or sister come over they'll say \"oh has fianc\u00e9 been polishing?\"  I usually say yes, even though its me that does it and I'm a grown ass adult. But then this further proves them right that I do nothing when in actual fact I do. But the thought of saying I did it makes me feel sick because they'll just poke fun at me.

There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.  If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.  To high school juniors and seniors:   Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. Here is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.  Why are skilled trades more relevant now?  These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to this article , 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey.  Is there any money in it?  There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later.  That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.  What are my options?  There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.  Apprenticeships are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage.  A recent report from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is here and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest American Job Center  The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the IBEW for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.  Trade Schools can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. Job Corps is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers.  Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, \"boot camp\" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.  Military training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort.  Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.  Regarding training, if you win the \"job lottery\" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.  Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.  I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.  TL;DR  If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.  Edit: Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an \"open\" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. \"No thanks\" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist \"open general\", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down.  Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying \"DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!\" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.  Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.  Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but \"Go to college if you want a good life!\" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.  /u/spudman238 [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "title": "LPT: If your printer is out of black ink, and you need urgent printout please change the color of the font #010101, which is 99% grey, it will help you quite a lot.", "author": "/u/Prabir007", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/6l8f0n/lpt_if_your_printer_is_out_of_black_ink_and_you/", "datetime": "2017-07-04T17:25:46+00:00", "summary_text": "Edit: Thank you stranger for this Gold.

Edit2: there\u2019s lots of reasons to discuss money with family. It\u2019s not always to beg for money, or to get into a fight about who had it worse.

I've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. Cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. For example, I have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and I can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. But once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.  Similarly, there was I time I had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. This goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. Properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.  /u/brentonstrine [link] [comments]"}]}
