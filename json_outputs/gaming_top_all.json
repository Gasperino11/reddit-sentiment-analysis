Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.  All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!  Edit 4: EA have a pattern of this behaviour so I have added the boycott EA hashtag.  /u/TheMadPuma [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "title": "As a teen in the 80s, my conservative God-fearing family wouldn't let me own Dungeons & Dragons.

Just two weeks back I wasn't able to login to my Origin Account (with Battlefield 5 Pre-ordered). I contacted EA Help and they are telling there there is no trace of my ID. I provided them my transaction IDs, Order IDs, Game Keys, But they are telling that they have no info. In fact they don't even know what happened. EA Help mercilessly disconnected the conversation with vague explanations.  My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall 2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, Medal of Honor, etc.  I even went to call them but they said that they can't do anything and don't know anything. Everything gone! but more surprising is that EA isn't even telling me what happened. They told me it's not their responsibility.  When i search in Battlelog and origin I still get my profile.  (The DP is my real picture from my days in Indian Air Force - Served for 10 years)  https://i.redd.it/us3przl9kjf11.jpg  attached my case link  --Removed--  Update: EA just deleted my only case ID and now I have nowhere to track the details of my conversation  https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg  kindly help me, please reach out to me if you can help me @  https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr  https://www.youtube.com/user/simplysamar  Update: Final Response from EA : \"We don't know anything about your account\"  Himanshu: I told you that there is no such information about \"\\ **@live.in\"*  you: ok what next??  you: i want my games back, I have the receipts, the credit card transactions, everything  you: how to get them backHimanshu: There is no account.  Himanshu: There is no details.  Himanshu: So I am unable to follow any process for you.  you: but how is it my fault...??? EA should be able to get me back what I purchased\\ *...*  Himanshu: The deletion request was requested from your side.  you: Atleast show me the acknowledgement evidence that someone who knows me requested for deletion of my account.. I don't even have any emails on this  Himanshu: How should I provide you any information ?  Himanshu: There is no account.  Himanshu: There is no case.  Himanshu: There are no such information.  Himanshu: There are nothing.  you: But that is EA's thing to keep.. how can i know if someone did it... and how can someone do it without having access to my email id and my mobile phone.. while 2FA was active  you: I have receipts so atleast give me my games back and get me a new account  Himanshu: There is no way to verify your proof of purchase.  Himanshu: We are unable to fetch any information by your game codes.you: nowhy?? i have transaction IDs, I still have that credit card, i have receipts, i have the same phone no, same email \\ * id*  you: why can't it be verified  Himanshu: Because all your details were on your account.  Himanshu: And now there is no account.  Himanshu: So how can we verify you and your purchases \\ * ?*  you: But my bank has the transaction IDs that i paid to EA... your billing team will have that  you: the way you want...you: i have access to everything related to this account except for the account itself that is on a portal managed by you  Himanshu: I checked your previous case.  Himanshu: We consulted with the billing team.Himanshu: We don't have any information.  Himanshu: So we are unable to verify you and your purchases.you: so what is your final call on this?  Himanshu: If you want a call back service.you: yes i do  Himanshu: I can generate a call back service for you.  *Himanshu: Please share your number. you: my no is +91\\ **********  Himanshu: Thank you.Himanshu: Now please cancel the browser\\ *.*  Himanshu: You will receive a call from our side within 3-4 hours.you: can you tell me what is the resolution to this from your end and what is the take away from this tiresome converstaion?  Himanshu: I tried all the possible ways for you.  Himanshu: But when there is no account I was unable to locate\\ * anything**.*  Himanshu: I will generate a call back service for \\ * you.*  you: wthe take away is it is not reliable to buy anything on Origin as anytime it can be deleted and EA will blindly tell it was deleted and would give no evidence of it  Himanshu: So you can receive \\ * a call support**.*  Himanshu: If we deleted your account that means account deletion was requested\\ * from your side.*  you: but you didn't give any proof or any mail from my id that requested it??  you: how can you claim that i requested it  you: that is really lame  Himanshu: How can you expect any information ?  Himanshu: When there is no account\\ * anymore.*  Himanshu: Everything is linked to your account.  Himanshu: Okay.  you: and my account was deleted by EA so ?????? what are you trying\\ * to suggest????*  Himanshu:\\ * We never do that.*  you: can't you yourself see that these are all vague arguments.. just going in circles  Himanshu: Request\\ * was from your side.you**: prove it*  you: provide email that came from my id for deleting this account  you: where is acknowledgement from my end  you: ??  Himanshu: Could you please prove it the deletion request \\ * was not from your side ? *  you: Yes i can... as there is no case ID nor any\\ * ** email that I sent*  you: there is nothing related to deletion in my mail box...

I do hope the information we covered helps with your issue. I do understand it was not the answer you wanted but I have provided a link below to our online AnswersHQ forums where you can leave any addition feedback you may have on this limitation. But if there is anything else we can do for you, please feel free to reach back out to us using the steps below. I hope you have a great rest of your day!  Log into Origin at  help.ea.com  Click on \"Manage my Accounts\"  Select \"My Cases\" and Select Case #XXXXXXXX  Select Resume and select Call Back or Chat  AnswersHQ Forums: r/ https://answers.ea.com/t5/Origin/ct-p/origin-en  Update : My case ID has been deleted by EA. I have tweeted this to Battlefield & DICE already. As of now I have no way to even track this and have been asked to wait. Atleast they considered taking a look.  https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr /status/1028218856605536257  Update 2: Reddit Mod has removed my post. not sure why  Update 3: Reddit Mod restored my post.  Update 4: I have provided my credit card details (last 6 digits) to EA although it seems they have no clue about my account. At this stage I have lost all hopes on getting this back. Waiting for an update.  Update 5: Sarah from EA has told me that they have failed to get any details related to my account and have asked me to create a new Origin account for which they will add Battlefield games. Not sure about other games so far. I have collated the Order IDs, Game keys (as much as possible) and last 6 digits of my credit cards and waiting for update. So far the response from EA has been really cold and I am getting repeated and vague questions in emails again and again even when I provided all these details long back.  Update 6 : I am continuously trying to reach EA using various channels (including Sarah's mail ID) but I am getting no response. They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.  Update 7: I have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want. All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. \"FlyingOfficer\". I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that \"We cannot assure anything at this moment\".  Update 8: Sarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.  https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg  Update 9 : Battlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.  Update 10: My Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.  \u200b  LETTER OF THANKS :  A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally) while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield. Having said that I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years. This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever . For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us. \\ The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.

Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out.  There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.  Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)  I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.  EDIT 2:  I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.  Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.  EDIT 4:  I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of all creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.  It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.   Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY  Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/  ^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said \"served as blueprints\" which is a nonsensical statement.  I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.  He starts his video off at the \"Gameplay\" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not too upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page. I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!  Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying \"hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video\", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like \"hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you\", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his.  EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.   EDIT 3: *  I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.  EDIT 5: It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.   Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this.  Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.  This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted. Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.   /u/_Robbie [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "title":
