I\u2019m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I\u2019m running for US Senate in West Virginia.   Barely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I\u2019ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn\u2019t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children\u2019s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens\u2019 lungs daily.   When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs.   \u201cWe would have to agree to disagree\u201d he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.  Not only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.  A month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn\u2019t like what he was up to. \u201cWhat you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,\u201d he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.  Like most of my generation I was born a coal miner\u2019s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed first-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.  The promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.  It\u2019s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don\u2019t want my children to inherit the struggles that we have had to endure.  I\u2019m proud to be a Justice Democrat and a Brand New Congress candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I\u2019ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the Brand New Congress platform , including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.

While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don't have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn't just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)!

And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was just caught throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.  This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can\u2019t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.  To push back, we\u2019ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order.  If you\u2019re a first responder, please add your name here.   In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here . California lawmakers are also holding a hearing TODAY on Verizon\u2019s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.  We are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything!

The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already signed it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.  Proof.   UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue?

To quote from my memoir, \"I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family.\" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.  Though I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.  When the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.  In 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.  My family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.  My wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4  USA link here : https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=middelmann&qid=1578093209&sr=8-6  Hello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter. I will be helping him with this post, by asking him your questions and writing his responses. He would like to add that this post makes it sound like his life was a lot more smooth and pre-planned than it was. His life was a lot more 'by the seat of his pants' than this suggests.  Below we have attached some photos from his life  https://imgur.com/6HHns4T  https://imgur.com/YXmbbvv  https://imgur.com/r8CXl4g  https://imgur.com/M293MDR  https://imgur.com/33gdQDW  https://imgur.com/xKS6AoK  https://imgur.com/NOhWVL6  https://imgur.com/8lR9RkT  NSFW https://imgur.com/t0VDnVX  \u200b  *** EDIT 1***  Hello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.  Also, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family. Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.  ***EDIT 2***  Robert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:  I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, \u201cFEARLESS\u201d \u201cA Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.\u201d I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler\u2019s military. I was one of them.  /u/fearless1927 [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "IAmA", "title": "I am Dr. Jane Goodall, a scientist, conservationist, peacemaker, and mentor.

I am not the typical \"high-ranking\" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.   FTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.  First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists. It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.  After Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a \"pussy\" for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a \"faggot\" . {Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}  Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.  (Ef yoo dad.)  I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).  I tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)  Obviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.  On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!   I'll be popping in when I get some notifications, but otherwise I'm just assuming this will disappear into the  abyss of the interweb tubes .

Earthjustice is a public interest law firm that uses the power of the courts to safeguard Americans\u2019 air, water, health, wild places, and wild species.  We\u2019re very busy. Donald Trump has tried to do more harm to the environment in his first 100 days than any other president in history. The New York Times recently published a list of 23 environmental rules the Trump administration has attempted to roll back, including limits on greenhouse gas emissions, new standards for energy efficiency, and even a regulation that stopped coal companies from dumping untreated waste into mountain streams.  Earthjustice has filed a steady stream of lawsuits against Trump. So far, we\u2019ve filed or are preparing litigation to stop the administration from, among other things:   gutting protections for 27 national monuments  re-opening the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil drilling  fast-tracking the Dakota Access pipeline  resuming coal mining on public land  allowing use of the dangerous pesticide chlorpyrifos on food crops  letting coal companies pollute drinking water sources  stalling national efforts to fight climate change, including the Clean Power Plan    My specialty is defending our country\u2019s wildlands, oceans, and wildlife in court from fossil fuel extraction, over-fishing, habitat loss, and other threats. Ask me about how our team plans to counter Trump\u2019s anti-environment agenda, which flies in the face of the needs and wants of voters.

For the last four years, I've reported on the Church of Scientology for the Tampa Bay Times.  For the last six months, I've been investigating a spate of real estate purchases in downtown Clearwater, Fla. The Church of Scientology and companies run by its members have spent $103 million since 2017 buying about 100 properties. They now own most commercial property on every block within walking distance of the waterfront. We built a graphic demonstrating just how little is left .  Downtown Clearwater is next to a beautiful waterfront just over the bridge from Clearwater Beach, a national tourist destination. Yet downtown is dotted with empty storefronts. The purchases took off as the city was developing a $64 million plan to turn the area around. We don\u2019t know whether these purchases will help the city\u2019s goal.  The church's tumultuous history in the city starts in 1975, when Scientology bought a downtown hotel with a straw corporation, secretly moved in and wrote plans to take control. I recap the whole history here .  In April 2017, the city snubbed Scientology Leader David Miscavige. Miscavige cut off all communication. Then LLCs controlled by church parishioners began buying up property at an unprecedented rate. In just three years, the downtown footprint of property tied to the church doubled.  The church has declined to speak with me and criticized my newspaper for portraying its members as \u201cmindless robots.\u201d But defectors from the church and city leaders believe there is little chance parishioners are making all these deals without the church\u2019s involvement.  For more, read the investigation here. We also published a story on what city council members think.

A mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it. Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law.  Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.  The surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications. While Section 702 ostensibly allows the government to target foreigners for surveillance, based on some estimates, roughly half of these files contain information about a U.S. citizen or resident, which the government can sift through without a warrant for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting our country from foreign threats.  Some in Congress would rather extend the law as is, or make it even worse.

EDIT 3:  A lot of people are asking me how I'm qualified to be a medic at 17. The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don't really see the term \"medic\" as anything more than \"person who gives medical assistance\" I'm sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I'm claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I'm also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.  I am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I'm planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.  Is this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we're all just volunteers, and we're all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we're all stepping up cause we're all Hong Kongers.  \u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\uff0c\u53cd\u6297  EDIT 4:  If you guys want to donate to our cause these 3 methods are the best way to do it   Donate directly to frontline medical teams and protesters (PM me and Ill get you in touch)  Donate to legal aid organisations such as \u661f\u706b\u806f\u76df (FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/ message them and ask for ways to donate)  Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)  Visit r/HongKong and read their pinned post   EDIT 5:  Due to an influx of people commenting and asking questions about HK, u/k0ella , u/Stand_With_HongKong and u/electr9 will be helping me answer some of them :)  EDIT 6: I'll be heading off to take a break now, I'll continue answering later on if I can, I'll be focusing on replying to messages and DMs now :) Thanks for all the questions!

I\u2019m FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel . I voted for net neutrality . I believe you should be able to go where you want and do what you want online without your internet provider getting in the way. And I\u2019m not done fighting for a fair and open internet.  I\u2019m an impatient optimist who cares about expanding opportunity through technology. That\u2019s because I believe the future belongs to the connected. Whether it\u2019s completing homework; applying for college, finding that next job; or building the next great online service, community, or app, the internet touches every part of our lives.  So ask me about how we can still save net neutrality. Ask me about the fake comments we saw in the net neutrality public record and what we need to do to ensure that going forward, the public has a real voice in Washington policymaking. Ask me about the Homework Gap \u2014the 12 million kids who struggle with schoolwork because they don\u2019t have broadband at home. Ask me about efforts to support local news when media mergers are multiplying. Ask me about broadband deployment and how wireless airwaves may be invisible but they\u2019re some of the most important technology infrastructure we have.  EDIT: Online now. Ready for questions!

We've spent just short of a year investigating 'zombie campaigns' : political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.  We found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members \u2013 all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.  It's not just small fish either. We found Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+ over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k since he retired. Mark Foley , who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. George LeMieux hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent $41k+ on management consulting services and then denied to us on camera when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. Mark Takai . A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.  And that's only a slice of what we've uncovered. You can read the full report here . It's about a 15 minute read. Or click here to see Noah's tv report, part two here .

After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked. I hope to bring my daughter to South Korea to live with me one day.

Proof: Instagram  Facebook  Blog   I am joined today by Ian and Sarah of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). Together, we are in NYC promoting LiNK\u2019s new film Sleep Well, My Baby . It is a short film about a North Korean woman who was trafficked and sold in China, and it is based on the real stories of North Korean women like myself. I\u2019m still learning English, so Sarah will be translating for me and Ian will be typing.  Liberty in North Korea is an international NGO dedicated to supporting the North Korean people. LiNK brings North Korean refugees through a 3,000-mile, modern-day 'underground railroad' to freedom and safety. To date they have rescued more than 700 North Korean refugees. These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country. The vision of LiNK is a free North Korea in our lifetimes.  Ok enough background.

Instead of shutting it down, United made Skiplagged go viral worldwide and supporters donated over $80,000! Today, there's no lawsuit and Skiplagged is still marching on. AMA", "author": "/u/skiplagged", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ux82r/united_airlines_sued_me_last_year_for_creating/", "datetime": "2015-11-30T23:34:30+00:00", "summary_text": "Update: reddit hug of death, try the Android or iOS apps if website fails <3 . We're also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you're interested.  This is a followup to the AMA I did last year , just after the federal lawsuit was filed.  Hey guys, I founded Skiplagged . Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don't. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city.  Basically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you'd simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. New York to San Francisco example . There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you'd have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can't miss flights on purpose.  While Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller's best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as \"skiplagging\". United Airlines didn't like any of this.  Around September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.  Fast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there's a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I'm 22. At worst, I'll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.  Skiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be on national tv . Then cnn reached out and published an article . Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they're doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions.  Fast-forward a couple of months, United's partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there's no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.  From running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community.  Also, I need your help.   The crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000. Vote here.

I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don\u2019t have an answer to a specific question or that I don\u2019t know enough to answer it.  I recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series Formative , in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY  The founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple\u2019s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.  I\u2019m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we\u2019ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.  I admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don\u2019t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.

He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result \u2013 as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.

Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more. My classmate Aalayah told me she had to use Nick's body as a shield once she saw he was dead immediately :(  Here is an edited version of the map to show the corner where I was hiding (blue), where Nick and Helena were (orange) and where the shooter was shooting from (red).

I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida\u2019s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings. Read more about them in the story .  In recent years, the hospital has been one of the most profitable psychiatric hospitals in Florida . It\u2019s also stood out for its shaky safety record. The hospital told us it had 75 serious incidents (assaults, injuries, runaway patients) in the 70 months it has been open. Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility.  Last year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon \u201cBJ\u201d Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers\u2019 practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits.

While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.  Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines , which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.  To understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions \u2014 including state and county governments \u2014 that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones . For various reasons \u2014 from a lack of sufficient funding to a preference for a convenient experience \u2014 America\u2019s voting machines won\u2019t be completely secure any time soon .  Ask us anything . ( Proof )  A bit more about us:  Eric Geller is the POLITICO cybersecurity reporter behind this project. His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states\u2019 efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO\u2019s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.  Before joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC\u2019s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration\u2019s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.\u2013China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.  J. Alex Halderman is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and Director of Michigan\u2019s Center for Computer Security and Society. He has performed numerous security evaluations of real-world voting systems, both in the U.S. and around the world. He helped conduct California\u2019s \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d electronic voting systems review, the first comprehensive election cybersecurity analysis commissioned by a U.S. state. He led the first independent review of election technology in India, and he organized the first independent security audit of Estonia\u2019s national online voting system. In 2017, he testified to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Elections. Prof. Halderman regularly teaches computer security at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He is the creator of Security Digital Democracy, a massive, open, online course that explores the security risks\u2014and future potential\u2014of electronic voting and Internet voting technologies.

Since many of you had questions about art-related stuff, you might be interested in taking part in the fan art contest: http://www.acidwizardstudio.com/?p=726  ---  We're Acid Wizard Studio, three college buddies (and a dog) from Poland who teamed up and decided to make a game. After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.  Before Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))  We knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.  After a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.  Unfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!  After that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating. We bit off way more than we could chew, but we knew we had something special in our hands, and we had to complete it in the way we envisioned it. After 3 years of hard, hard work, the game is finished, and we're pretty proud of it.

I then co-founded Mozilla & Firefox, and in 2004, helped launch Firefox 1.0, which would grow to become the world\u2019s most popular browser by 2009. Yesterday, we launched Brave 1.0 to help users take back their privacy, to end an era of tracking & surveillance capitalism, and to reward users for their attention and allow them to easily support their favorite content creators online.  Outside of work, I enjoy piano, chess, reading and playing with my children. Ask me anything!  Brian Bondy ( u/bbondy )  Proof:  https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1194709298548334592  https://brave.com/about/  Hello everyone, I am Brian R. Bondy, and I\u2019m the co-founder, CTO and lead developer at Brave . Other notable projects I\u2019ve worked on include Khan Academy, Mozilla and Evernote. I was a Firefox Platform Engineer at Mozilla, Linux software developer at Army Simulation Centre, and researcher and software developer at Corel Corporation. I received Microsoft\u2019s MVP award for Visual C++ in 2010, and am proud to be in the top 0.1% of contributors on StackOverflow.  Family is my \"raison d'\u00eatre\". My wife Shannon and I have 3 sons: Link, Ronnie, and Asher. When I'm not working, I'm usually running while listening to audiobooks. My longest runs were in 2019 with 2 runs just over 100 miles each. Ask me anything!  \u200b  Our Goal with Brave  Yesterday, we launched the 1.0 version of our privacy web browser, Brave . Brave is an open source browser that blocks all 3rd-party ads, trackers, fingerprinting, and cryptomining; upgrades your connections to secure HTTPS; and offers truly Private \u201cIncognito\u201d Windows with Tor \u2014right out of the box. By blocking all ads and trackers at the native level, Brave is up to 3-6x faster than other browsers on page loads , uses up to 3x less data than Chrome or Firefox, and helps you extend battery life up to 2.5x.  However, the Internet as we know it faces a dilemma. We realize that publishers and content creators often rely on advertising revenue in order to produce the content we love. The problem is that most online advertising relies on tracking and data collection in order to target users, without their consent . This enables malware distribution, ad fraud, and social/political troll warfare. To solve this dilemma, we came up with a solution called Brave Rewards , which is now available on all platforms, including iOS.  Brave Rewards is entirely opt-in, and the idea is simple: if you choose to see privacy-respecting ads that you can control and turn off at any time, you earn 70% of the ad revenue . Your earnings, denominated in \u201cBasic Attention Tokens\u201d (BAT), accrue in a built-in browser wallet which you can then use to tip and support your favorite creators, spread among all your sites and channels, redeem for products, or exchange for cash. For example, when you navigate to a website, watch a YouTube video, or read a Reddit comment you like, you can tip them with a simple click. What\u2019s amazing is that over 316,000 websites, YouTubers, etc. have already signed up, including major sites like Wikipedia , The Guardian , The Washington Post , Khan Academy and even NPR.org . You can too.  In the future, websites will also be able to run their own privacy-respecting ads that you can opt into, which will give them 70% of the revenue, and you\u2014their audience\u2014a 15% share (we always pay the ad slot owner 70%, and we always pay you the user at least what we get). They\u2019re privacy-respecting because Brave moves all the interest-matching onto your device and into the browser client side, so your data never leaves your device in the first place. Period. All confirmations use an anonymous and unlinkable blind-signature cryptographic protocol. This flipping-the-script approach to keep all detailed intelligence and identity where your data originates, in your browser, is the key to ending personal data collection and surveillance capitalism once and for all.  Brave is available on both desktop (Windows PC, MacOS, Linux) and on mobile (Android, iOS), and our pre-1.0 browser has already reached over 8.7 million monthly active users\u2014something we\u2019re very proud of. We hope you try Brave and join this growing movement for the future of the Web. Ask us anything!  \u200b  Edit: Thanks everybody! It was a pleasure answering your questions in detail. It\u2019s very encouraging to see so many people interested in Brave\u2019s mission and in taking online privacy seriously. User consciousness is rising quickly now; the future of the web depends on it. We hope you give Brave 1.0 a try. And remember: you can sign up now as a creator and begin receiving tips from other Brave users for your websites, YouTube videos, Tweets, Twitch streams, Github comments, etc.  console.log(\"Until next time.

Rather than give up, I bought four books from Amazon and spent the next few months learning how. A few months later, some of the hockey sales staff teamed up with me to get our prototype off the ground and together we now operate a small software company.  The idea was to create a crowd-sourced light show by synchronizing smartphone flashlights you see at concerts to the beat of the music. You can check out a video of one of our light shows here at the Villanova-Purdue men\u2019s basketball game two months ago. Basically, it works by using high-pitched, inaudible sound waves in a similar way that Bluetooth uses electromagnetic waves. All the devices in this video are getting their instructions from the music and could be in airplane mode. This means that the software can even be used to relay data to or synchronize devices through your television or computer. Possible uses range from making movies interactive with your smartphone, to turning your $10 speaker into an iBeacon (interactive video if you\u2019re watching on a laptop).
