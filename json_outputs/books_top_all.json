Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.  But there\u2019s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.  We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.  Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.  To reach the call in line directly by phone, call 202-930-8550 .  When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:   I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.\"  \"Yes, but what about the firemen, then?\" asked Montag.  \"Ah.\" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. \"What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes.

I'm not saying that #1 is better than #10, I'm simply saying I enjoyed it more. Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.  \u200b  I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well. Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson. I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills. Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).  Apologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.  \u200b  So, without further ado, here are my top 15:  \u200b   The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)  - I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion. A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away. The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it. The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned. This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read. I literally shouted out loud \"NO NO no no no no no no...\" at one point and had to put it down for the day.  Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons) - The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none. I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well. 7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike. That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.  The Stand (Steven King) - A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list. Loved this one. I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed. There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.  I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) - I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics. I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read. I was dead wrong. I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be. Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.  Dune (Frank Herbert) - No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said. If you haven't read it, do so immediately.  The Forge of God  (Greg Bear) - An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is \"I'm sorry, I'm too late\" or something to that effect. I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite. Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation. Huge action, a real page-turner. This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written specifically to be made into a movie.  The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) - I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read. I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War. Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently. Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  Not Alone (Craig Falconer) - A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure. Why is it so high up on this list? Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite parts of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them. This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years. And what does he do? He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence. Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.  The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) - An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories. If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.  Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg) - Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night. Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in. Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.  Old Man's War (John Scalzi) - Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war. I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.  Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) - Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature. Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.  Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) - One night, all the stars go out. It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why. Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on. I particularly liked the ending to this book. Great read, fun.  Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)- Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War. I think I read all 3 of these back to back. They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them. Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me.  Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle) - Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't that far ahead of humans, technologically. And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far. Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters. The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked. Like baby elephants, pretty much.   \u200b  Honorable Mentions: Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters  \u200b  Yes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  Anyway, that's my list. Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading. Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.  Edit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it\u2019s even science fiction.  Edit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit. I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep. I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day. And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention. Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.  Edit3: All right, all right, I'll join GoodReads.

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them.  I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page.  I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying.  But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book.  Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.  Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read \"The Slow Regard of Silent Things\" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.  Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.  ERS people can and often are insufferable under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.  It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.  It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.  Final update: this post will be referenced as I shop my manuscript around to publishers. Almost a quarter of a million views....still unbelievable.

Maybe some of you feel the same.  I was reading a post yesterday, where the OP (16 years old) was asking for recommendations about more \u2018mature\u2019 books. He enjoyed reading YA and stuff, but wondered what else was out there. When someone asked him why he would want to do this, OP said something along the lines of he felt \u2018ashamed\u2019 to still be reading these kinds of books.  Someone downvoted him for it. Similarly, looking down the thread I could see that many people who had offered recommendations about mature books had been down voted. I then started thinking about threads that I have commented on. There has been so many times where I have tried to contribute thoughtfully to a discussion \u2013 just like the 16 year old OP - but because others didn\u2019t agree, I\u2019ve been downvoted.  I can\u2019t be the only person to have noticed this trend, and it\u2019s a bummer. r/books is a place where we discuss and share opinions about the thing we love most of all \u2013 books. It should be a place where we can get inspiration and, hopefully, learn about writers that ordinarily would have passed us by. But instead, I feel like there are a lot of people here that treat the place as a zero-sum game, where they are \u2018right\u2019 and you are \u2018wrong\u2019 \u2013 and downvote accordingly. You don\u2019t like my favourite book? - Downvote. You explain why in a thoughtful, polite manner that encourages further discussion? - Fuck you. Downvote. The more this trend continues, the more the sub declines until all that\u2019s left are people jealously guarding their opinions, unable to hear those of others over the roar of their internal rage.  I mean, I try and my bit to combat this. I don\u2019t downvote other people\u2019s opinions, even if they are very different from my own, and I do this because that\u2019s not what the function is for. The sidebar: It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion [\u2026] in a safe, supportive environment. I save the downvotes for people who break these rules - the trolls and dickheads spewing racism.  Which isn\u2019t to say I\u2019m perfect \u2013 I\u2019ve got into some heated arguments on here and said some stuff I\u2019ve regretted, but in those instances I\u2019ve tried to apologise because after I\u2019d calmed down, I realised that while we all have different personal tastes \u2013 they are just that: personal tastes. They are not objective. In the same way, r/books frustrates me sometimes in how it\u2019s focused on the same books (Hitchhikers, TLoTR, Pratchett, Gaiman etc.), but I don\u2019t downvote these threads or the people commenting on them, because this is a place where people should be allowed to discuss their passions without getting blue-arrowed.  The world is full of people screaming at each other with their fingers in their ears. r/books doesn\u2019t have to become another such place.  I have a feeling I\u2019m opening myself up to a world of hurt with this post, but fuck it \u2013 I care about the sub, and want to see it thrive.  /u/Dos_Manos [link] [comments]"}]}
