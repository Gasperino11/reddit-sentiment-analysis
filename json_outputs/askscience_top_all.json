One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education.  I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?  An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. However, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an educational divide .

We are very excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST / 15:30 UTC) from the LIGO collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!   Links:   YouTube Announcement  LIGO  Gravitational wave primer by Discovery  Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics    FAQ:   Where do they come from?   The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks).   How fast do they go?   Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ( wiki ).   Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?   The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the indirect detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, PSR B1913+16 .  In 2014, the BICEP2 team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.   Does this mean we can control gravity?   No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see here .   What's the practical application?   Here is a nice and concise review.   How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?   Here is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)   Stay tuned for updates!  Edits:   The youtube link was updated with the newer stream.  It's started!  LIGO HAS DONE IT  Event happened 1.3 billion years ago.  Data plot  Nature announcement .  Paper in Phys. Rev. Letters (if you can't access the paper, someone graciously posted a link )  Two stellar mass black holes (36+5-4 and 29+/-4 M_sun) into a 62+/-4 M_sun black hole with 3.0+/-0.5 M_sun c 2 radiated away in gravitational waves. That's the equivalent energy of 5000 supernovae!  Peak luminosity of 3.6+0.5-0.4 x 10 56 erg/s, 200+30-20 M_sun c 2 / s. One supernova is roughly 10 51 ergs in total!  Distance of 410+160-180 megaparsecs (z = 0.09+0.03-0.04)  Final black hole spin \u03b1 = 0.67+0.05-0.07  5.1 sigma significance (S/N = 24)  Strain value of = 1.0 x 10 -21  Broad region in sky roughly in the area of the Magellanic clouds (but much farther away!)  Rates on stellar mass binary black hole mergers: 2-400 Gpc -3 yr -1  Limits on gravitons: Compton wavelength > 10 13 km, mass m < 1.2 x 10 -22 eV / c 2 (2.1 x 10 -58 kg!)

There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety. It is later implied that she would have died from this contact if not for the fetus \"absorbing\" the radiation and dying immediately after birth.   Is actual radiation contamination that contagious?  This article seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.  Is Chernobyl's portrayal of person-to-person radiation contamination that sensationalized?
