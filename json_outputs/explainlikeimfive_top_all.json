I\u2019m realizing my question is actually more specifically \u201cWhy does 2\u00b0 matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?\u201d  I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I\u2019m just not quite understanding how it\u2019s so devastating, when 2\u00b0 seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I\u2019d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts.  It\u2019s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon.  And no, I\u2019m not a climate change denier. I\u2019m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.   Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3 I need to go to sleep. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I\u2019ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning.  Main things I\u2019ve learned, based on Redditors\u2019 comments, for those just joining:   Average global temp is neither local weather outside , nor is it weather on a particular day . It is the average weather for the year across the globe. Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2\u00b0 warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can\u2019t handle 2\u00b0 warmer average global weather. They are not the same. For context, here is an XKCD explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4\u00b0 less than it is today. The \"little ice age\" was just ~1-2\u00b0 colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.  While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of average global temp , since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. This is what was confusing me.  The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem.  Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could\u2019ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected).  The change in global average (not 2\u00b0 local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.  The issue is not the 2\u00b0 warmer temp. It is that those 2\u00b0 could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2\u00b0 difference can quickly become 20\u00b0. The 2\u00b0 may be our event horizon.  Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I\u2019m being told that higher C02 is better for plants , and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I\u2019m still unclear on the details here.]  A major part of the issue is the timing. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s that it\u2019s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There\u2019s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions.  We don\u2019t actually know exactly what will happen because it\u2019s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.   /u/WOWSuchUsernameAmaze [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "title": "ELI5: Why do snipers need a 'spotter'?", "author": "/u/britboy4321", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/74f9nn/eli5_why_do_snipers_need_a_spotter/", "datetime": "2017-10-05T11:15:02+00:00", "summary_text": "/u/britboy4321 [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "title": "ELI5: How do we know some numbers, like Pi are endless, instead of just a very long number?", "author": "/u/FHM_IV", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/g99rw0/eli5_how_do_we_know_some_numbers_like_pi_are/", "datetime": "2020-04-27T21:23:22+00:00", "summary_text": "/u/FHM_IV [link] [comments]"}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "title": "ELI5: How does gravity make time slow down?", "author": "/u/ReaperEngine", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6rx0q3/eli5_how_does_gravity_make_time_slow_down/", "datetime": "2017-08-06T06:52:17+00:00", "summary_text": "Edit: So I asked this question last night on a whim, because I was curious, and I woke up to an astounding number of notifications, and an extra 5000 karma @___________@  I've tried to go through and read as many responses as I can, because holy shit this is so damn interesting, but I'm sure I'll miss a few.  Thank you to everyone who has come here with something to explain, ask, add, or correct. I feel like I've learned a lot about something I've always loved, but had trouble understanding because, hell, I ain't no physicist :)  Edit 2: To elaborate. Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.  I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right? Getting into semantics about what kind of relativity something falls under, while interesting and even auxiliary, is somewhat superfluous in trying to grasp the simpler details. Of course, input is appreciated, but don't go too far out of your own way if you don't need to!  /u/ReaperEngine [link] [comments]"}]}
