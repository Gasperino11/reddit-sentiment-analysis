This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall 2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, Medal of Honor, etc.  I even went to call them but they said that they can't do anything and don't know anything. Everything gone! but more surprising is that EA isn't even telling me what happened. They told me it's not their responsibility.  When i search in Battlelog and origin I still get my profile.  (The DP is my real picture from my days in Indian Air Force - Served for 10 years)  https://i.redd.it/us3przl9kjf11.jpg  attached my case link  --Removed--  Update: EA just deleted my only case ID and now I have nowhere to track the details of my conversation  https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg  kindly help me, please reach out to me if you can help me @  https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr  https://www.youtube.com/user/simplysamar  Update: Final Response from EA : \"We don't know anything about your account\"  Himanshu: I told you that there is no such information about \"\\ **@live.in\"*  you: ok what next??  you: i want my games back, I have the receipts, the credit card transactions, everything  you: how to get them backHimanshu: There is no account.  Himanshu: There is no details.  Himanshu: So I am unable to follow any process for you.  you: but how is it my fault...??? EA should be able to get me back what I purchased\\ *...*  Himanshu: The deletion request was requested from your side.  you: Atleast show me the acknowledgement evidence that someone who knows me requested for deletion of my account.. I don't even have any emails on this  Himanshu: How should I provide you any information ?  Himanshu: There is no account.  Himanshu: There is no case.  Himanshu: There are no such information.  Himanshu: There are nothing.  you: But that is EA's thing to keep.. how can i know if someone did it... and how can someone do it without having access to my email id and my mobile phone.. while 2FA was active  you: I have receipts so atleast give me my games back and get me a new account  Himanshu: There is no way to verify your proof of purchase.  Himanshu: We are unable to fetch any information by your game codes.you: nowhy?? i have transaction IDs, I still have that credit card, i have receipts, i have the same phone no, same email \\ * id*  you: why can't it be verified  Himanshu: Because all your details were on your account.  Himanshu: And now there is no account.  Himanshu: So how can we verify you and your purchases \\ * ?*  you: But my bank has the transaction IDs that i paid to EA... your billing team will have that  you: the way you want...you: i have access to everything related to this account except for the account itself that is on a portal managed by you  Himanshu: I checked your previous case.  Himanshu: We consulted with the billing team.Himanshu: We don't have any information.  Himanshu: So we are unable to verify you and your purchases.you: so what is your final call on this?  Himanshu: If you want a call back service.you: yes i do  Himanshu: I can generate a call back service for you.  *Himanshu: Please share your number. you: my no is +91\\ **********  Himanshu: Thank you.Himanshu: Now please cancel the browser\\ *.*  Himanshu: You will receive a call from our side within 3-4 hours.you: can you tell me what is the resolution to this from your end and what is the take away from this tiresome converstaion?  Himanshu: I tried all the possible ways for you.  Himanshu: But when there is no account I was unable to locate\\ * anything**.*  Himanshu: I will generate a call back service for \\ * you.*  you: wthe take away is it is not reliable to buy anything on Origin as anytime it can be deleted and EA will blindly tell it was deleted and would give no evidence of it  Himanshu: So you can receive \\ * a call support**.*  Himanshu: If we deleted your account that means account deletion was requested\\ * from your side.*  you: but you didn't give any proof or any mail from my id that requested it??  you: how can you claim that i requested it  you: that is really lame  Himanshu: How can you expect any information ?  Himanshu: When there is no account\\ * anymore.*  Himanshu: Everything is linked to your account.  Himanshu: Okay.  you: and my account was deleted by EA so ?????? what are you trying\\ * to suggest????*  Himanshu:\\ * We never do that.*  you: can't you yourself see that these are all vague arguments.. just going in circles  Himanshu: Request\\ * was from your side.you**: prove it*  you: provide email that came from my id for deleting this account  you: where is acknowledgement from my end  you: ??  Himanshu: Could you please prove it the deletion request \\ * was not from your side ? *  you: Yes i can... as there is no case ID nor any\\ * ** email that I sent*  you: there is nothing related to deletion in my mail box...  Himanshu: Just like you I can prove that we didn't delete y\\ *our account from our**** sid**e. *  you: wow....  you: thanks  END OF CONVERSATION  My Latest Purchase details:  Removed on request by EA  my other order IDs  Removing my order IDs as requested by EA  Mail from EA Help:  FROM:Thomas RSENT:10-Aug-2018 7:51:14 PM  I wanted to thank you again for contacting EA Help. I do hope the information we covered helps with your issue. I do understand it was not the answer you wanted but I have provided a link below to our online AnswersHQ forums where you can leave any addition feedback you may have on this limitation. But if there is anything else we can do for you, please feel free to reach back out to us using the steps below. I hope you have a great rest of your day!  Log into Origin at  help.ea.com  Click on \"Manage my Accounts\"  Select \"My Cases\" and Select Case #XXXXXXXX  Select Resume and select Call Back or Chat  AnswersHQ Forums: r/ https://answers.ea.com/t5/Origin/ct-p/origin-en  Update : My case ID has been deleted by EA. I have tweeted this to Battlefield & DICE already. As of now I have no way to even track this and have been asked to wait. Atleast they considered taking a look.  https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr /status/1028218856605536257  Update 2: Reddit Mod has removed my post. not sure why  Update 3: Reddit Mod restored my post.  Update 4: I have provided my credit card details (last 6 digits) to EA although it seems they have no clue about my account. At this stage I have lost all hopes on getting this back. Waiting for an update.  Update 5: Sarah from EA has told me that they have failed to get any details related to my account and have asked me to create a new Origin account for which they will add Battlefield games. Not sure about other games so far. I have collated the Order IDs, Game keys (as much as possible) and last 6 digits of my credit cards and waiting for update. So far the response from EA has been really cold and I am getting repeated and vague questions in emails again and again even when I provided all these details long back.  Update 6 : I am continuously trying to reach EA using various channels (including Sarah's mail ID) but I am getting no response. They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.  Update 7: I have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want. All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. \"FlyingOfficer\". I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that \"We cannot assure anything at this moment\".  Update 8: Sarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.  https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg  Update 9 : Battlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.  Update 10: My Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.  \u200b  LETTER OF THANKS :  A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally) while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield. Having said that I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years. This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever . For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us. \\ The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.

Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out.  There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.  Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)  I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.  EDIT 2:  I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.  Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.  EDIT 4:  I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of all creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.  It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.   Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY  Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/  ^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said \"served as blueprints\" which is a nonsensical statement.  I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.  He starts his video off at the \"Gameplay\" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not too upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page. I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!  Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying \"hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video\", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like \"hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you\", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his.  EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.   EDIT 3: *  I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.  EDIT 5: It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.   Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this.  Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.  This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted. Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.   /u/_Robbie [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": 0.0,

The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA. At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay. These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa , the current CTO.) Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.  This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students going up by as much as 300% , which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion. Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA.  This is why every major science organization has voiced opposition to the current tax plan , make no mistake, this plan will undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA .  In comic form from PhD Comics .  What can we do to stop it? Call your representatives in congress and let them know. It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to. If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.  Moderator Note  This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking. The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions. Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context. The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect.

We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.  WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.  WHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.  WHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.  WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist.  HOW CAN I JOIN?  Click here and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one , and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.  /u/JPTIII [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.30000001192092896, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.699999988079071, "num_entities": 4}, {"subreddit": "Music", "title": "The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving.

The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.  We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.  Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.  To reach the call in line directly by phone, call 202-930-8550 .  When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:   I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them.

I know this topic has been done by many, including Gus Johnson, but it's now Serial Abuser Chris Brown's birthday and his fans are in full swing.  Here's just a short list of everything publicly he's done wrong:    He beat Rihanna nearly to death [2009]  He stormed off set and broke something when asked about that assault [2011]  Stole someone's phone just for taking pictures of him [2012]  Shoved someone in a club so hard she needed surgery [2013]  Picked a fight with Frank Ocean over a parking space and threatened to kill him  Arrested for Assualt after a fight infront of a DC hotel [2013]  Violated the rehab program's rules [2014]  Named in a battery case, only dropped because victim declined to press charges [2015]  Serial Abuser Chris broke a woman's phone after she refused to leave his bus as well as throwing her out [2015]  Accused of punching a woman in the face and taking her phone during a private party [2016]  Manager accused him of attacking her [2016]  Threatened a woman with a gun and arrested after hours long police standoff [2016]  Sucker punched a photographer [2017]  Sent threatening text messages to an ex-girlfriend [2017]  Detained in Paris after woman says he raped her [2019]*  Paris Rape accuser says he forced her to take cocaine and raped her multiple times [2019]*   *This is still an open case. Not much is known except French (like American) police must release someone if there is no evidence in a certain time period. That time period is 24 hours unless proper cause is determined to extend to 48 total hours. This is why Brown was able to leave the country after a few days.   I'm just gonna say, how is this guy still popular? He's been to jail for assault more times than I've gotten an A on an exam. And this is just what we know about. What else is there that isn't public?  Edit: Sort by controversial if you want to see some stupidity.  Edit 2: Since apparently people are questioning the motive:  I didn't plan this for days or anything. I literally saw his name trending on Twitter at ~3pm today and said \"Hey, isn't this guy a major duche canoe? Let's remind the world of him shall we?\" A quick google search later, I found 3 articles that were compiled lists of things he's directly done wrong. For years that were missing from the lists, I did a different search specifically for that year. I checked every post on this list. They all happened. At this point, it doesn't matter why they happened because I'm pretty sure there's 0 excuse for a police standoff outside your own home right? Or am I just crazy?  IDK. I don't have a motive in this other than to remind the world that this guy exists. If people in other industries can be torn down by ONE accusation (see Toby from Tobuscus) then why is Brown still thriving when he's got over a dozen under his belt? And to make it even worse, most of them he's been officially convicted of. Like, spent time in jail, convicted.  I seem to have made my point. Anything that's not ^ was purely coincidental or made up by you. It was not my intention and likely never will be. I've read every top level comment that's been responded here. All 1.5k of you or something.  I know we can \"separate the art from the artist\" but that doesn't make much sense does it? In other industries, people accused of harassment lose their jobs and have their careers stripped without being proven guilty. Meanwhile, Serial Abuser Chris Brown here (and others in the music industry) are perfectly fine with beating and raping people and still being praised as a \"king/queen\" or \"hero.\" It's disgusting. We need a Weinstein era purge of the music industry. Get rid of these garbage humans. Most of the time, they're only useful for their voice and lots of people have those.  You know what, screw it. I'm going to start addressing him a \"Serial Abuser Chris Brown\" now. Not just \"(Serial Abuser) Chris Brown.\"  Edit 3: And.... locked. Racists and others of the like are out in full swing on this post. Just a couple reminders.  Most of this ^ isn't \"Alleged\", especially the Rihanna incident. He was found guilty so he is guilty.  Secondly, this is a list of things that factually happened. There's no \"Allegedly\" to having a police standoff. That for a fact happened.  /u/Sprinkley_Binkley [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": 0.6000000238418579, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.6000000238418579, "num_entities": 2}, {"subreddit": "Music", "title": "Trey Parker - America, Fuck Yeah!

Just to be clear - I understand that there are other ways to support artists... including \"buying the record, buying merch, and going to a show\". My point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have LPs, CDs, or even MP3s lying around. I have never used or wanted band merch, and I simply don't get a chance to see bands I really like that often. So my point, once again, was to have a feature to DONATE to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that I listen to music on, which I realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well.  Also to clarify, I understand that a lot of work goes into writing/recording/putting out a record; in a perfect world, this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their label/legal/creative team however they saw fit.  EDIT: Wow! I don't really understand how gold/upvotes work... I made this post a few days ago and didn't even realize that ANYONE had commented on it. Psyched to read all your thoughts!

Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.

I\u2019m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I\u2019m running for US Senate in West Virginia.   Barely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I\u2019ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn\u2019t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children\u2019s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens\u2019 lungs daily.   When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs.   \u201cWe would have to agree to disagree\u201d he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.  Not only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.  A month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn\u2019t like what he was up to. \u201cWhat you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,\u201d he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.  Like most of my generation I was born a coal miner\u2019s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed first-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.  The promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.  It\u2019s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don\u2019t want my children to inherit the struggles that we have had to endure.  I\u2019m proud to be a Justice Democrat and a Brand New Congress candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I\u2019ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the Brand New Congress platform , including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.

A little bit about my grandpa: he grew up in Washington State, and has traveled quite a bit. He worked for the FDA for many years, some as an investigator, some as a pharmacist. He served in the air force during World War 2 as a photographer.  Clearly there's more to him than this, so ask him some questions!

He's flabbergasted at how many people are asking questions and upvoting him, at first he thought it was all people I knew haha. He's so happy! We're gonna take a little break, some of my family just arrived for a visit.  4:14 PM ET: we're back! gonna knock out some more questions until I have to dip. Appreciate all the interest! Sorry he sometimes misunderstands some questions aha.  With a lot of these I'll ask him and he says 'let me think about that a bit' and I'll circle back and I guess he hasn't finished thinking about them - so sorry for those still waiting! lol  5:05 PM ET: So he's starting to fall asleep as I ask him questions, so I think we're gonna call it a day aha. He's in rehab for a broken hip right now, and a bit forgetful and confused at times, so hopefully that will give some explanation to some of the stranger answers he's said. Thank you so much for everyone who asked things and commented and told stories and thanked him, he is just so pleased!!! I'll go through this as I'm able and answer what I can from my perspective. Next time I visit him, I'll try to get a few more answered. He'll remember this for a long time. Thank you all, SO MUCH!!!  11/6/19 5:39 PM ET: Hi all! I stopped by my grandpa's current place today and asked and answered a few more questions! He gets tired pretty quickly, and tends to say \"I need to think about that\" for things that aren't direct (broad questions like \"meaning of life\" and such), so for further questions I would encourage more specific questions.

We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don't have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn't just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it's been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that.

And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was just caught throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.  This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can\u2019t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.  To push back, we\u2019ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order.  If you\u2019re a first responder, please add your name here.   In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here . California lawmakers are also holding a hearing TODAY on Verizon\u2019s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.

The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already signed it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.  Proof.   UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue?

To quote from my memoir, \"I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family.\" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.  Though I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.  When the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.  In 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.  My family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.  My wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4  USA link here : https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=middelmann&qid=1578093209&sr=8-6  Hello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter. I will be helping him with this post, by asking him your questions and writing his responses. He would like to add that this post makes it sound like his life was a lot more smooth and pre-planned than it was. His life was a lot more 'by the seat of his pants' than this suggests.  Below we have attached some photos from his life  https://imgur.com/6HHns4T  https://imgur.com/YXmbbvv  https://imgur.com/r8CXl4g  https://imgur.com/M293MDR  https://imgur.com/33gdQDW  https://imgur.com/xKS6AoK  https://imgur.com/NOhWVL6  https://imgur.com/8lR9RkT  NSFW https://imgur.com/t0VDnVX  \u200b  *** EDIT 1***  Hello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.  Also, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family. Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.  ***EDIT 2***  Robert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:  I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, \u201cFEARLESS\u201d \u201cA Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.\u201d I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler\u2019s military. I was one of them.  /u/fearless1927 [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.10000000149011612, "sentiment_magnitude": 1.100000023841858, "num_entities": 16}, {"subreddit": "IAmA", "title": "I am Dr. Jane Goodall, a scientist, conservationist, peacemaker, and mentor.

I am not the typical \"high-ranking\" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.   FTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.  First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists. It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.  After Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a \"pussy\" for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a \"faggot\" . {Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}  Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.  (Ef yoo dad.)  I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).  I tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)  Obviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.  On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!   I'll be popping in when I get some notifications, but otherwise I'm just assuming this will disappear into the  abyss of the interweb tubes .

Donald Trump has tried to do more harm to the environment in his first 100 days than any other president in history. The New York Times recently published a list of 23 environmental rules the Trump administration has attempted to roll back, including limits on greenhouse gas emissions, new standards for energy efficiency, and even a regulation that stopped coal companies from dumping untreated waste into mountain streams.  Earthjustice has filed a steady stream of lawsuits against Trump. So far, we\u2019ve filed or are preparing litigation to stop the administration from, among other things:   gutting protections for 27 national monuments  re-opening the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil drilling  fast-tracking the Dakota Access pipeline  resuming coal mining on public land  allowing use of the dangerous pesticide chlorpyrifos on food crops  letting coal companies pollute drinking water sources  stalling national efforts to fight climate change, including the Clean Power Plan    My specialty is defending our country\u2019s wildlands, oceans, and wildlife in court from fossil fuel extraction, over-fishing, habitat loss, and other threats.

For the last four years, I've reported on the Church of Scientology for the Tampa Bay Times.  For the last six months, I've been investigating a spate of real estate purchases in downtown Clearwater, Fla. The Church of Scientology and companies run by its members have spent $103 million since 2017 buying about 100 properties. They now own most commercial property on every block within walking distance of the waterfront. We built a graphic demonstrating just how little is left .  Downtown Clearwater is next to a beautiful waterfront just over the bridge from Clearwater Beach, a national tourist destination. Yet downtown is dotted with empty storefronts. The purchases took off as the city was developing a $64 million plan to turn the area around. We don\u2019t know whether these purchases will help the city\u2019s goal.  The church's tumultuous history in the city starts in 1975, when Scientology bought a downtown hotel with a straw corporation, secretly moved in and wrote plans to take control. I recap the whole history here .  In April 2017, the city snubbed Scientology Leader David Miscavige. Miscavige cut off all communication. Then LLCs controlled by church parishioners began buying up property at an unprecedented rate. In just three years, the downtown footprint of property tied to the church doubled.  The church has declined to speak with me and criticized my newspaper for portraying its members as \u201cmindless robots.\u201d But defectors from the church and city leaders believe there is little chance parishioners are making all these deals without the church\u2019s involvement.

A mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it. Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law.  Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.  The surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications. While Section 702 ostensibly allows the government to target foreigners for surveillance, based on some estimates, roughly half of these files contain information about a U.S. citizen or resident, which the government can sift through without a warrant for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting our country from foreign threats.  Some in Congress would rather extend the law as is, or make it even worse. We need to make clear to our lawmakers that we\u2019re expecting them to rein government\u2019s worst and most harmful spying powers. Call your member here now.

With how the situation is progressing, I think that not even the volunteer medics will be spared.  I saw that other post where a protester set up an AMA and thought that maybe I could chime in as well.  I've been at the protests during weekends and holidays since I'm also currently in secondary school. I've witnessed first hand the injuries sustained by the protesters due to their participation in the movement and have been in a few situations where I almost got arrested.  You can ask me stuff about the injuries I've treated, my background, my opinions about the protests, or what I had for breakfast, anything goes :)  Here's a picture of my EMS vest along with my first aid certification in the cardholder, helmet, goggles, and 3M respirator as proof, let me know if you need more proof and I'll do my best to accommodate!  https://truepic.com/rql7n74u/  I will be answering questions as they keep coming in, so give me all ya got.  ----------------  INFORMATION ABOUT HONG KONG PROTESTS + DONATION INFORMATION  Telegram group for live Hong Kong news updates https://t.me/hkprotests_reddit  https://youtu.be/6_RdnVtfZPY Hong Kong's Huge Protests Explained  https://youtu.be/cMkkS_pZX1Q How China is framing the protesters  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PuPr2O2RT First aid segment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rehNF9hz47A First aid segment  GoFundMe Link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/fund-medical-supplies-to-hong-kong-volunteer-ems?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet (Thanks u/GunGrabbingMemes for setting this up!)  -----------------  EDIT: Sorry for the clumsy title, I used the word protest 4 times in the same sentence oops  EDIT 2: I'm gonna go ahead and eat dinner, Ill be back to answering questions in an hour or so (7:42 PM HK time), thanks for all the questions so far guys!  EDIT 3:  A lot of people are asking me how I'm qualified to be a medic at 17. The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don't really see the term \"medic\" as anything more than \"person who gives medical assistance\" I'm sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I'm claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I'm also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.  I am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I'm planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.  Is this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we're all just volunteers, and we're all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we're all stepping up cause we're all Hong Kongers.  \u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\uff0c\u53cd\u6297  EDIT 4:  If you guys want to donate to our cause these 3 methods are the best way to do it   Donate directly to frontline medical teams and protesters (PM me and Ill get you in touch)  Donate to legal aid organisations such as \u661f\u706b\u806f\u76df (FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/ message them and ask for ways to donate)  Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)  Visit r/HongKong and read their pinned post   EDIT 5:  Due to an influx of people commenting and asking questions about HK, u/k0ella , u/Stand_With_HongKong and u/electr9 will be helping me answer some of them :)  EDIT 6: I'll be heading off to take a break now, I'll continue answering later on if I can, I'll be focusing on replying to messages and DMs now :) Thanks for all the questions!

We've spent just short of a year investigating 'zombie campaigns' : political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.  We found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members \u2013 all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.  It's not just small fish either. We found Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+ over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k since he retired. Mark Foley , who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. George LeMieux hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent $41k+ on management consulting services and then denied to us on camera when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. Mark Takai . A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.  And that's only a slice of what we've uncovered. You can read the full report here . It's about a 15 minute read. Or click here to see Noah's tv report, part two here .

I will try to answer some questions later tonight if I have some time :)  Annyeonghaseyo!   My name is Joy and I\u2019m from North Korea. I escaped to China when I was 18 but was immediately trafficked and sold as a bride to a Chinese man for $3,000 USD. Life was difficult, but I gave birth to a daughter who became the joy of my life. After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked. I hope to bring my daughter to South Korea to live with me one day.  Because I have family in North Korea that could face punishment if my identity was revealed, I cannot share my real name or show my face.  Proof: Instagram  Facebook  Blog   I am joined today by Ian and Sarah of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). Together, we are in NYC promoting LiNK\u2019s new film Sleep Well, My Baby . It is a short film about a North Korean woman who was trafficked and sold in China, and it is based on the real stories of North Korean women like myself. I\u2019m still learning English, so Sarah will be translating for me and Ian will be typing.  Liberty in North Korea is an international NGO dedicated to supporting the North Korean people. LiNK brings North Korean refugees through a 3,000-mile, modern-day 'underground railroad' to freedom and safety. To date they have rescued more than 700 North Korean refugees. These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country. The vision of LiNK is a free North Korea in our lifetimes.  Ok enough background.

We're also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you're interested.  This is a followup to the AMA I did last year , just after the federal lawsuit was filed.  Hey guys, I founded Skiplagged . Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don't. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city.  Basically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you'd simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. New York to San Francisco example . There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you'd have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can't miss flights on purpose.  While Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller's best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as \"skiplagging\". United Airlines didn't like any of this.  Around September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.  Fast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there's a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I'm 22. At worst, I'll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.  Skiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be on national tv . Then cnn reached out and published an article . Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they're doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions.  Fast-forward a couple of months, United's partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there's no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.  From running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community.  Also, I need your help.   The crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000. Vote here.

I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don\u2019t have an answer to a specific question or that I don\u2019t know enough to answer it.  I recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series Formative , in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY  The founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple\u2019s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.  I\u2019m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we\u2019ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.  I admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don\u2019t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.

I think this is going to be my third AMA, so the answers should hopefully come a little faster this time. I have a new independent film called \"Middle Man\" which is opening in theaters today. It's a super dark comedy that I'm extremely proud of. It's been on the festival circuit (and has done very well!) so I'm sure a few people here may have already seen it. If so, no spoilers! Lol.  In the film, I play a comedian named Lenny. When Lenny's mother suddenly dies, he quits his job and heads to Vegas in search of fame. He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result \u2013 as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.  Here's a link to the trailer. I hope you like it! http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/  Here's me and my doggos for \"proof\" http://imgur.com/a/4Ti7B  I will be back in about two hours to answer your questions.

Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more. My classmate Aalayah told me she had to use Nick's body as a shield once she saw he was dead immediately :(  Here is an edited version of the map to show the corner where I was hiding (blue), where Nick and Helena were (orange) and where the shooter was shooting from (red).

I spent the last several months looking into a psychiatric hospital that forcibly holds patients for days longer than allowed while running up their medical bills. I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida\u2019s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings. Read more about them in the story .  In recent years, the hospital has been one of the most profitable psychiatric hospitals in Florida . It\u2019s also stood out for its shaky safety record. The hospital told us it had 75 serious incidents (assaults, injuries, runaway patients) in the 70 months it has been open. Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility.  Last year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon \u201cBJ\u201d Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers\u2019 practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits. He has no experience in healthcare. Now he runs the 126-bed hospital.  We also found that the hospital is part of a large chain of behavioral health facilities called Acadia Healthcare, which has had problems across the country.

While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.  Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines , which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.  To understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions \u2014 including state and county governments \u2014 that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones . For various reasons \u2014 from a lack of sufficient funding to a preference for a convenient experience \u2014 America\u2019s voting machines won\u2019t be completely secure any time soon .

His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states\u2019 efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO\u2019s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.  Before joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC\u2019s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration\u2019s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.\u2013China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.  J. Alex Halderman is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and Director of Michigan\u2019s Center for Computer Security and Society. He has performed numerous security evaluations of real-world voting systems, both in the U.S. and around the world. He helped conduct California\u2019s \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d electronic voting systems review, the first comprehensive election cybersecurity analysis commissioned by a U.S. state. He led the first independent review of election technology in India, and he organized the first independent security audit of Estonia\u2019s national online voting system. In 2017, he testified to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Elections. Prof. Halderman regularly teaches computer security at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He is the creator of Security Digital Democracy, a massive, open, online course that explores the security risks\u2014and future potential\u2014of electronic voting and Internet voting technologies.

Since many of you had questions about art-related stuff, you might be interested in taking part in the fan art contest: http://www.acidwizardstudio.com/?p=726  ---  We're Acid Wizard Studio, three college buddies (and a dog) from Poland who teamed up and decided to make a game. After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.  Before Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))  We knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.  After a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.  Unfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!  After that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating. We bit off way more than we could chew, but we knew we had something special in our hands, and we had to complete it in the way we envisioned it.

I\u2019m Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave . In 1995, I created the JavaScript programming language in 10 days while at Netscape. I then co-founded Mozilla & Firefox, and in 2004, helped launch Firefox 1.0, which would grow to become the world\u2019s most popular browser by 2009. Yesterday, we launched Brave 1.0 to help users take back their privacy, to end an era of tracking & surveillance capitalism, and to reward users for their attention and allow them to easily support their favorite content creators online.  Outside of work, I enjoy piano, chess, reading and playing with my children. Ask me anything!  Brian Bondy ( u/bbondy )  Proof:  https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1194709298548334592  https://brave.com/about/  Hello everyone, I am Brian R. Bondy, and I\u2019m the co-founder, CTO and lead developer at Brave . Other notable projects I\u2019ve worked on include Khan Academy, Mozilla and Evernote. I was a Firefox Platform Engineer at Mozilla, Linux software developer at Army Simulation Centre, and researcher and software developer at Corel Corporation. I received Microsoft\u2019s MVP award for Visual C++ in 2010, and am proud to be in the top 0.1% of contributors on StackOverflow.  Family is my \"raison d'\u00eatre\". My wife Shannon and I have 3 sons: Link, Ronnie, and Asher. When I'm not working, I'm usually running while listening to audiobooks. My longest runs were in 2019 with 2 runs just over 100 miles each. Ask me anything!  \u200b  Our Goal with Brave  Yesterday, we launched the 1.0 version of our privacy web browser, Brave . Brave is an open source browser that blocks all 3rd-party ads, trackers, fingerprinting, and cryptomining; upgrades your connections to secure HTTPS; and offers truly Private \u201cIncognito\u201d Windows with Tor \u2014right out of the box. By blocking all ads and trackers at the native level, Brave is up to 3-6x faster than other browsers on page loads , uses up to 3x less data than Chrome or Firefox, and helps you extend battery life up to 2.5x.  However, the Internet as we know it faces a dilemma. We realize that publishers and content creators often rely on advertising revenue in order to produce the content we love. The problem is that most online advertising relies on tracking and data collection in order to target users, without their consent . This enables malware distribution, ad fraud, and social/political troll warfare. To solve this dilemma, we came up with a solution called Brave Rewards , which is now available on all platforms, including iOS.  Brave Rewards is entirely opt-in, and the idea is simple: if you choose to see privacy-respecting ads that you can control and turn off at any time, you earn 70% of the ad revenue . Your earnings, denominated in \u201cBasic Attention Tokens\u201d (BAT), accrue in a built-in browser wallet which you can then use to tip and support your favorite creators, spread among all your sites and channels, redeem for products, or exchange for cash. For example, when you navigate to a website, watch a YouTube video, or read a Reddit comment you like, you can tip them with a simple click. What\u2019s amazing is that over 316,000 websites, YouTubers, etc. have already signed up, including major sites like Wikipedia , The Guardian , The Washington Post , Khan Academy and even NPR.org . You can too.  In the future, websites will also be able to run their own privacy-respecting ads that you can opt into, which will give them 70% of the revenue, and you\u2014their audience\u2014a 15% share (we always pay the ad slot owner 70%, and we always pay you the user at least what we get). They\u2019re privacy-respecting because Brave moves all the interest-matching onto your device and into the browser client side, so your data never leaves your device in the first place. Period. All confirmations use an anonymous and unlinkable blind-signature cryptographic protocol. This flipping-the-script approach to keep all detailed intelligence and identity where your data originates, in your browser, is the key to ending personal data collection and surveillance capitalism once and for all.  Brave is available on both desktop (Windows PC, MacOS, Linux) and on mobile (Android, iOS), and our pre-1.0 browser has already reached over 8.7 million monthly active users\u2014something we\u2019re very proud of. We hope you try Brave and join this growing movement for the future of the Web. Ask us anything!  \u200b  Edit: Thanks everybody! It was a pleasure answering your questions in detail. It\u2019s very encouraging to see so many people interested in Brave\u2019s mission and in taking online privacy seriously. User consciousness is rising quickly now; the future of the web depends on it. We hope you give Brave 1.0 a try. And remember: you can sign up now as a creator and begin receiving tips from other Brave users for your websites, YouTube videos, Tweets, Twitch streams, Github comments, etc.  console.log(\"Until next time.

Rather than give up, I bought four books from Amazon and spent the next few months learning how. A few months later, some of the hockey sales staff teamed up with me to get our prototype off the ground and together we now operate a small software company.  The idea was to create a crowd-sourced light show by synchronizing smartphone flashlights you see at concerts to the beat of the music. You can check out a video of one of our light shows here at the Villanova-Purdue men\u2019s basketball game two months ago. Basically, it works by using high-pitched, inaudible sound waves in a similar way that Bluetooth uses electromagnetic waves. All the devices in this video are getting their instructions from the music and could be in airplane mode. This means that the software can even be used to relay data to or synchronize devices through your television or computer. Possible uses range from making movies interactive with your smartphone, to turning your $10 speaker into an iBeacon (interactive video if you\u2019re watching on a laptop).  If you\u2019re interested in using this in your own apps, or are curious and want to read more, check out a detailed description of the app software here .

This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. This fight isn\u2019t over though, there is still a clear path to victory.  The organizations behind Battle For The Net are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via Congressional Review Act (CRA).  The CRA let\u2019s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it\u2019s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC\u2019s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. But it won\u2019t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.  We can\u2019t stop now. Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act  You\u2019ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:   I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a \u201cresolution of disapproval\u201d reversing the FCC\u2019s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.\u201d   You can also text BATTLE to Text \"BATTLE\" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers  We can still win this. Even if you\u2019ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.  Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education.  I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?  An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. However, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an educational divide .

We are very excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST / 15:30 UTC) from the LIGO collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!   Links:   YouTube Announcement  LIGO  Gravitational wave primer by Discovery  Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics    FAQ:   Where do they come from?   The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks).   How fast do they go?   Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ( wiki ).   Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?   The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the indirect detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, PSR B1913+16 .  In 2014, the BICEP2 team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.   Does this mean we can control gravity?   No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see here .   What's the practical application?   Here is a nice and concise review.   How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?   Here is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)   Stay tuned for updates!  Edits:   The youtube link was updated with the newer stream.  It's started!  LIGO HAS DONE IT  Event happened 1.3 billion years ago.  Data plot  Nature announcement .  Paper in Phys. Rev.

That's the equivalent energy of 5000 supernovae!  Peak luminosity of 3.6+0.5-0.4 x 10 56 erg/s, 200+30-20 M_sun c 2 / s. One supernova is roughly 10 51 ergs in total!  Distance of 410+160-180 megaparsecs (z = 0.09+0.03-0.04)  Final black hole spin \u03b1 = 0.67+0.05-0.07  5.1 sigma significance (S/N = 24)  Strain value of = 1.0 x 10 -21  Broad region in sky roughly in the area of the Magellanic clouds (but much farther away!)  Rates on stellar mass binary black hole mergers: 2-400 Gpc -3 yr -1  Limits on gravitons: Compton wavelength > 10 13 km, mass m < 1.2 x 10 -22 eV / c 2 (2.1 x 10 -58 kg!)

Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily \"get on my back, we'll get him together\".  So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts \"where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...\"  Edit: OMG my first gold!

What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!\"  Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.  \"No, no, just name anyone else,\" Dave says.  \"President Obama,\" his boss quickly retorts.  \"Yup,\" Dave says, \"Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,\" and off they go.  At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, \"Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.\"  Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.  \"Pope Francis,\" his boss replies.  \"Sure!\" says Dave. \"I've known the Pope for years.\" So off they fly to Rome.  Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, \"This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.  Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.  And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...  And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.  And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.  Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.  The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.  The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.  The old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"   EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up! Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.  The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..  Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.  The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.  After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on.  The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.  So, as the couple passes, he says to them, \"Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?\"  Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,  \"Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.\"  /u/rumor247 [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.4000000059604645, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "num_entities": 2}, {"subreddit": "Jokes", "title": "Yesterday my daughter was playing in the garden when I saw her kill a butterfly.

I\u2019m just not quite understanding how it\u2019s so devastating, when 2\u00b0 seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I\u2019d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts.  It\u2019s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon.  And no, I\u2019m not a climate change denier. I\u2019m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.   Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3 I need to go to sleep. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I\u2019ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning.  Main things I\u2019ve learned, based on Redditors\u2019 comments, for those just joining:   Average global temp is neither local weather outside , nor is it weather on a particular day . It is the average weather for the year across the globe. Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2\u00b0 warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can\u2019t handle 2\u00b0 warmer average global weather. They are not the same. For context, here is an XKCD explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4\u00b0 less than it is today. The \"little ice age\" was just ~1-2\u00b0 colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.  While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of average global temp , since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. This is what was confusing me.  The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem.  Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could\u2019ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected).  The change in global average (not 2\u00b0 local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.  The issue is not the 2\u00b0 warmer temp. It is that those 2\u00b0 could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2\u00b0 difference can quickly become 20\u00b0. The 2\u00b0 may be our event horizon.  Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I\u2019m being told that higher C02 is better for plants , and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I\u2019m still unclear on the details here.]  A major part of the issue is the timing. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s that it\u2019s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There\u2019s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions.  We don\u2019t actually know exactly what will happen because it\u2019s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.   /u/WOWSuchUsernameAmaze [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.20000000298023224, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.6000000238418579, "num_entities": 9}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "title": "ELI5: Why do snipers need a 'spotter'?", "author": "/u/britboy4321", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/74f9nn/eli5_why_do_snipers_need_a_spotter/", "datetime": "2017-10-05T11:15:02+00:00", "summary_text": "/u/britboy4321 [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.4000000059604645, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "num_entities": 3}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "title": "ELI5: How do we know some numbers, like Pi are endless, instead of just a very long number?", "author": "/u/FHM_IV", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/g99rw0/eli5_how_do_we_know_some_numbers_like_pi_are/", "datetime": "2020-04-27T21:23:22+00:00", "summary_text": "/u/FHM_IV [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.10000000149011612, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "num_entities": 4}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "title": "ELI5: How does gravity make time slow down?", "author": "/u/ReaperEngine", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6rx0q3/eli5_how_does_gravity_make_time_slow_down/", "datetime": "2017-08-06T06:52:17+00:00", "summary_text": "Edit: So I asked this question last night on a whim, because I was curious, and I woke up to an astounding number of notifications, and an extra 5000 karma @___________@  I've tried to go through and read as many responses as I can, because holy shit this is so damn interesting, but I'm sure I'll miss a few.

Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.  I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right?

Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.  But there\u2019s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.  We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.  Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.  To reach the call in line directly by phone, call 202-930-8550 .  When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:   I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.\"  \"Yes, but what about the firemen, then?\" asked Montag.  \"Ah.\" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. \"What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.  \"Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon\"  And thats when some gears started turning.  So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.  Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.  I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.  \u200b  I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well. Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson. I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills. Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).  Apologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.  \u200b  So, without further ado, here are my top 15:  \u200b   The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)  - I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion. A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away. The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it. The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned. This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read. I literally shouted out loud \"NO NO no no no no no no...\" at one point and had to put it down for the day.  Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons) - The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none. I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well. 7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike. That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.  The Stand (Steven King) - A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list. Loved this one. I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed. There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.  I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) - I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics. I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read. I was dead wrong. I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be. Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.  Dune (Frank Herbert) - No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said. If you haven't read it, do so immediately.  The Forge of God  (Greg Bear) - An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is \"I'm sorry, I'm too late\" or something to that effect. I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite. Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation. Huge action, a real page-turner. This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written specifically to be made into a movie.  The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) - I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read. I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War. Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently. Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  Not Alone (Craig Falconer) - A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure. Why is it so high up on this list? Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite parts of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them. This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years. And what does he do? He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence. Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.  The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) - An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories. If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.  Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg) - Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night. Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in. Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.  Old Man's War (John Scalzi) - Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war. I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.  Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) - Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature. Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.  Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) - One night, all the stars go out. It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why. Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on. I particularly liked the ending to this book. Great read, fun.  Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)- Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War. I think I read all 3 of these back to back. They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them. Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me.  Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle) - Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't that far ahead of humans, technologically. And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far. Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters. The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked. Like baby elephants, pretty much.   \u200b  Honorable Mentions: Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters  \u200b  Yes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  Anyway, that's my list. Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading. Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.  Edit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it\u2019s even science fiction.  Edit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit. I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep. I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day. And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention. Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.  Edit3: All right, all right, I'll join GoodReads.

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them.  I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page.  I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying.  But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book.  Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.  Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read \"The Slow Regard of Silent Things\" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.  Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

I love you all  Edit #2: how the fuck did this happen  Edit #3: I want to take this opportunity to say a few things about borderline. Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.  ERS people can and often are insufferable under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.  It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.  It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.  Final update: this post will be referenced as I shop my manuscript around to publishers. Almost a quarter of a million views....still unbelievable. I'm about 70% done with the edits I was given and then....man, who knows.  Thanks for everything Reddit. You made me feel amazing and increased my chances ten fold.

Maybe some of you feel the same.  I was reading a post yesterday, where the OP (16 years old) was asking for recommendations about more \u2018mature\u2019 books. He enjoyed reading YA and stuff, but wondered what else was out there. When someone asked him why he would want to do this, OP said something along the lines of he felt \u2018ashamed\u2019 to still be reading these kinds of books.  Someone downvoted him for it. Similarly, looking down the thread I could see that many people who had offered recommendations about mature books had been down voted. I then started thinking about threads that I have commented on. There has been so many times where I have tried to contribute thoughtfully to a discussion \u2013 just like the 16 year old OP - but because others didn\u2019t agree, I\u2019ve been downvoted.  I can\u2019t be the only person to have noticed this trend, and it\u2019s a bummer. r/books is a place where we discuss and share opinions about the thing we love most of all \u2013 books. It should be a place where we can get inspiration and, hopefully, learn about writers that ordinarily would have passed us by. But instead, I feel like there are a lot of people here that treat the place as a zero-sum game, where they are \u2018right\u2019 and you are \u2018wrong\u2019 \u2013 and downvote accordingly. You don\u2019t like my favourite book? - Downvote. You explain why in a thoughtful, polite manner that encourages further discussion? - Fuck you. Downvote. The more this trend continues, the more the sub declines until all that\u2019s left are people jealously guarding their opinions, unable to hear those of others over the roar of their internal rage.  I mean, I try and my bit to combat this. I don\u2019t downvote other people\u2019s opinions, even if they are very different from my own, and I do this because that\u2019s not what the function is for. The sidebar: It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion [\u2026] in a safe, supportive environment. I save the downvotes for people who break these rules - the trolls and dickheads spewing racism.  Which isn\u2019t to say I\u2019m perfect \u2013 I\u2019ve got into some heated arguments on here and said some stuff I\u2019ve regretted, but in those instances I\u2019ve tried to apologise because after I\u2019d calmed down, I realised that while we all have different personal tastes \u2013 they are just that: personal tastes. They are not objective. In the same way, r/books frustrates me sometimes in how it\u2019s focused on the same books (Hitchhikers, TLoTR, Pratchett, Gaiman etc.), but I don\u2019t downvote these threads or the people commenting on them, because this is a place where people should be allowed to discuss their passions without getting blue-arrowed.  The world is full of people screaming at each other with their fingers in their ears. r/books doesn\u2019t have to become another such place.  I have a feeling I\u2019m opening myself up to a world of hurt with this post, but fuck it \u2013 I care about the sub, and want to see it thrive.  /u/Dos_Manos [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "num_entities": 3}], [{"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "title": "LPT: keep your mouth shut, and don't volunteer information", "author": "/u/w2555", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/f6jt5e/lpt_keep_your_mouth_shut_and_dont_volunteer/", "datetime": "2020-02-19T23:48:09+00:00", "summary_text": "I had a phone interview scheduled this morning, but accidentally slept through it.

It\u2019s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.  Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. It\u2019s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.

I figured I\u2019d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn\u2019t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it\u2026.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that\u2019s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:  1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot, as they\u2019ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.  So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there\u2019s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it\u2019s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they\u2019re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn\u2019t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!  Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven\u2019t passed, then it\u2019s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign. Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.   Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what\u2019s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don\u2019t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You\u2019ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it\u2019s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.   For reference, here\u2019s what a normal cranking sound should be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0  Here\u2019s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It\u2019s at about :55 secs : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng  If you listen closely, you\u2019ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.  If the car you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don\u2019t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you\u2019re looking at with something like \u201cYYYY Make Model clear flood\u201d or \u201cYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump\u201d and see if there\u2019s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.  Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.   Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don\u2019t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you\u2019re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it\u2019s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it\u2019s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford\u2019s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That\u2019s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven\u2019t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That\u2019s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that\u2019s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That\u2019s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don\u2019t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you\u2019re SOL there.  Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it\u2019s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.  Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they\u2019ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It\u2019s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that\u2019s better. Indy\u2019s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that\u2019s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that\u2019s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don\u2019t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn\u2019t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.  Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?  Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can\u2019t see?  How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.  Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they\u2019re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.  Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn\u2019t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They\u2019ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They\u2019ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you\u2019re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.  Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you\u2019re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it\u2019s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you\u2019re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it\u2019s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.  This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It\u2019s also pretty important. You\u2019ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it\u2019s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that\u2019s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it\u2019s adding, but sometimes it\u2019s subtracting). I don\u2019t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.   So what you\u2019re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it\u2019s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You\u2019re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find \u201cshort term fuel trim\u201d and \u201clong term fuel trim\u201d. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.  Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%  Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%  Let\u2019s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You\u2019re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the \u201cbank\u201d or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one \u201cside\u201d so you\u2019ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you\u2019ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you\u2019re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn\u2019t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.  When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you\u2019ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let\u2019s take a look at some examples on a V8:  STFT1 : 3 ... STFT2 : 6  LTFT1 : 2 ... LTFT2 : 1  So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That\u2019s pretty good.  STFT1 : -5 ... STFT2 : 3  LTFT1 : 3 ... LTFT2 : 1  Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that\u2019s good.  STFT1 : 6 ... STFT2 : 7  LTFT1 : 10 ... LTFT2 :15  Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That\u2019s not good. Walk away from this one.  Here's one more that's a littlte different:  STFT1 : -20 ... STFT2 : -20  LTFT1 : 22 ... LTFT2 : 20  Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.  Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.  Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.   Last and not least, don\u2019t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don\u2019t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you\u2019re worried about is no big deal, it\u2019s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it\u2019s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn\u2019t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don\u2019t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.   I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents\u2019 cars, friends\u2019 cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you\u2019re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won\u2019t forget anything.  \u200b  EDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post here talking about it, and a few other good things as well.  \u200b  EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.  \u200b  EDIT2 - Fixed some formatting  \u200b  EDIT3 - Thanks for all the replies and awards. I'm glad people found this useful. But seriously, no more awards. Save your money for gas to return all those Christmas presents you don't want.  \u200b  EDIT4 - There are lots of comments and questions. I'll try to answer what I can but there are so many. I'll get back to most of you eventually. Gotta get some work done....working on a Saturday (sucks)  \u200b  EDIT5 - I'm back from the dead!  \u200b  EDIT6 - added some good info brought up in comments, expanded on a few things, laymanized it a little more, explained some technical stuff. Still can't get the STFT and LTFT examples to format the way I wanted. Best I can do  \u200b  EDIT 8 - Good night everyone. Thanks for all the awards and comments and conversations.

There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.  If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.  To high school juniors and seniors:   Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. Here is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.  Why are skilled trades more relevant now?  These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to this article , 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey.  Is there any money in it?  There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later.  That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.  What are my options?  There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.  Apprenticeships are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage.  A recent report from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is here and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest American Job Center  The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the IBEW for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.  Trade Schools can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. Job Corps is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers.  Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, \"boot camp\" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.  Military training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort.  Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.  Regarding training, if you win the \"job lottery\" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.  Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.  I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.  TL;DR  If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.  Edit: Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an \"open\" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. \"No thanks\" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist \"open general\", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down.  Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying \"DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!\" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.  Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.  Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but \"Go to college if you want a good life!\" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.  /u/spudman238 [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": 0.4000000059604645, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.800000011920929, "num_entities": 8}, {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "title": "LPT: If your printer is out of black ink, and you need urgent printout please change the color of the font #010101, which is 99% grey, it will help you quite a lot.", "author": "/u/Prabir007", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/6l8f0n/lpt_if_your_printer_is_out_of_black_ink_and_you/", "datetime": "2017-07-04T17:25:46+00:00", "summary_text": "Edit: Thank you stranger for this Gold.

Not only will they provide quality OJT, but most places will provide a free college degree like mine did.  /u/xjxhsyzg [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "sentiment_magnitude": 2.299999952316284, "num_entities": 10}, {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "title": "LPT: If a child tells you they are uncomfortable around an adult, please listen.", "author": "/u/Thor2324", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/elhpt7/lpt_if_a_child_tells_you_they_are_uncomfortable/", "datetime": "2020-01-07T21:04:03+00:00", "summary_text": "/u/Thor2324 [link] [comments]", "sentiment_score": -0.699999988079071, "sentiment_magnitude": 0.699999988079071, "num_entities": 3}, {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "title": "LPT: Be skeptical of products that say \"Clinically proven\".

Often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it. At first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning? The answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether I do it or not. Now I don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.  I also noticed that I was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. People would come but nobody ever really made a point to say that they appreciated I was doing it. I stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. Now I only do it if I feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.
